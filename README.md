# KMEANS_IMAGE_SEGMENTATION

- Image segmentation is partitioning an image into regions (pixels) having similar visual appearanace corresponding to parts of objects.
- We will extracting the dominant 'K' colors from the image using KMeans (say 4).
- We will be applying KMeans to each pixels, which will be reassigned to closest of the K-colors, leading to segmentation.
- The output of the model is shown below :
