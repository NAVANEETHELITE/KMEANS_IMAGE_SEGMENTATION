# KMEANS_IMAGE_SEGMENTATION

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation">Image segmentation</a> is partitioning an image into regions (pixels) having similar visual appearanace corresponding to parts of objects.
- We will extract the dominant 'K' colors from the image using KMeans (say 4).
- We will apply KMeans to each pixels, which will be reassigned to closest of the K-colors, leading to segmentation.
- The input and output of the model is shown below :
